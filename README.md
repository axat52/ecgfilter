# ecgfilter
#I designed a notch FIR filter using MATLAB to remove power line interference from an ECG signal.
#In MATLAB, I utilized functions from the Signal Processing Toolbox, such as fir1 or fdesign, to design the FIR filter with specific specifications.
#The specifications included parameters like sampling frequency, filter order, and notch frequency to effectively target the power line interference.
#By applying the designed FIR filter to the ECG signal, I successfully attenuated the power line interference, enhancing the quality of the ECG waveform.
#Furthermore, I performed the implementation of the notch FIR filter using a TI DSP kit and Code Composer Studio C-compiler, which enabled real-time removal of power line #interference during ECG signal acquisition and processing.
